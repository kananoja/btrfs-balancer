Btrfs balancer is a set of tools and scripts that create systemd service
to periodically run btrfs balance operation on a devices filesystem.

It consists of roughly 3 parts:

* keepalive tool for keeping device out of suspend when we run the balance
* btrfs-balance script that does simple filesystem status check to see if
  the balance operation is worth running and executes btrfs balance and
  keepalive when needed.
* systemd service files to run btrfs-balance periodically

Building keepalive:

  make all

Building RPM package with mb script:

  mb build -t <your target> rpm/btrfs-balancer.spec
