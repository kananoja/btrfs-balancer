Btrfs balancer is a set of scripts that create systemd service
to periodically run btrfs balance operation on a devices filesystem.

It consists of roughly 2 parts:

* btrfs-balance script that does simple filesystem status check to see if
  the balance operation is worth running and executes btrfs balance when needed.
  The btrfs-balance script can be run also stand-alone.
* systemd service files to run btrfs-balance periodically

Install from source:
make install [DESTDIR=myrootfolder]

Building RPM package with mb script:

  mb build -t <your target> rpm/btrfs-balancer.spec
