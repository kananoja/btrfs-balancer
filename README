btrfs-balancer is a D-Bus service for running btrfs operations on
a device's filesystem periodically via systemd, or on request.

It consists of roughly 2 parts:

* btrfs-balancer D-Bus service with auto-activation that starts automatically
  when requested and stops when idle.
  The btrfs-balancer has a client mode in which it acts as a command line
  client. Invoke "btrfs-balancer --help" for details.

* systemd service files to run the btrfs-balancer maintenance method
  periodically.

Install from source:
  qmake
  make
  make install [DESTDIR=myrootfolder]

Building RPM package with mb script:

  mb build -t <your target> rpm/btrfs-balancer.spec
